usurvey is a microsurvey app written in Django optimized for use with a MySQL
database backend. For this app:

- Admins can submit survey questions with multiple choice answers.
- Guests can visit the app using their browser, and they will receive a random
  survey question that they can answer.
- The answers are recorded and displayed to the admin.
- Guests should not see the same question twice.
- The app is viewable on both desktop and mobile.

Getting Started
===============

I was using Ubuntu 14.04 when making this project. As such, to install MySQL
(and the necessary dependencies that our Python requirements have) I ran the
following::

    $ sudo apt-get install mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev

This is important because the Python environment requires the "mysql_config"
utility in order to install "mysqlclient". Once you have the backend
database installed locally, it should (hopefully) already be running. If it's
not, look up the documentation on how to get it started. For me, it was already
running, but I could have started it with::

    $ sudo service mysql start

For the MySQL server, I'm just using the username "root" and the password
"password". Obviously, this will not fly for a production environment, but it's
good enough to get us off the ground. By default, the database should not be
accessible outside of your machine. Now, let's create our database::

    $ mysql -u root -p
    Enter password: 
    Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MySQL connection id is 48
    Server version: 5.5.60-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 (Ubuntu)

    mysql> create database usurvey;
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
    mysql > quit
    Bye
    $

Now, that we have mysql and our database installed and running, we can focus on
the Python and Django dependencies. First, ensure you have Python (version 3 or
greater) and virtualenv installed. For Ubuntu 14.04, this is probably::

    sudo apt-get install python3 python-virtualenv

Now, we can create an environment using virtualenv. For me, this was::

    $ virtualenv -p `which python3` env

Now, activate the environment::

    $ . env/bin/activate

This will prepend the ``(env)`` string to the beginning of your shell and will
use the environment under the ``env`` directory as your environment. Every time
you open a new shell, you have to "activate" it. You can "deactivate" the
environment later (not now) using::

    (env)$ deactivate

Now, you can install the necessary packages with::

    (env)$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

At this point, we can start using Django! First (and every time new changes are
pulled), you need to migrate the database. This is done with::

    (env)$ ./manage.py migrate

Now, we can create our superuser that we'll use to generate questions. This
only needs to be done once.::

    (env)$ ./manage.py createsuperuser

Finally, we can start the server::

    (env)$ ./manage.py runserver

It should be accessible from your browser as "localhost:8000". Obviously, this
is configurable, but it's good enough for development and functional testing.
To access the admin page, add "/admin" to the end of the URL string.
