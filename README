usurvey is a microsurvey app written in Django optimized for use with a MySQL
database backend. For this app:

- Admins can submit survey questions with multiple choice answers.
- Guests can visit the app using their browser, and they will receive a random
  survey question that they can answer.
- The answers are recorded and displayed to the admin.
- However, only the latest answer a specific guest has given will be shown.
- The app is viewable on both desktop and mobile.

Getting Started
===============

To get started, ensure you have Python (version 3 or greater) and virtualenv
installed. Create an environment using virtualenv. For me, this was::

    $ virtualenv -p `which python3` env

Now, activate the environment::

    $ . env/bin/activate

This will prepend the ``(env)`` string to the beginning of your shell and will
use the environment under the ``env`` directory as your environment. Now, you
can install the necessary packages with::

    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
